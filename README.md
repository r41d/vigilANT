# vigilANT

Small minimalistic game where you play as an ant, run around to collect sugar which sometimes spawns from rain drops.
Was made for a GameJam from April 15th - 17th, 2016.
The motto was '**Desperate Rocket**'.
This is why there is a rocket which is desperate to leave, to get to his/her rocket sweetheart.
